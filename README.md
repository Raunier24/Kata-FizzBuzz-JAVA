A modified version of the classic FizzBuzz kata. Input a number, and the program will output:

"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
"Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
"FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 Â  
To run:

Clone this repository.
Compile and run the Java file.
Enter a number when prompted.
Enjoy!
